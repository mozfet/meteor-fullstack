# Meteor Fullstack

Setting up a new Meteor production ready project from scratch on a new machine takes lots of time, up to several days of troubleshooting. Not anymore!

Meteor Fullstack is a template application includes all the boilerplate and setup ready to use and include cross-platform scripts to make it fast and easy to customise, secure, manage and deploy your app in DEV, STAGE and PROD environments.

Meteor Fullstack always try to make use of the latest versions of dependencies and build tools, however due to open source development cycles and historic dependencies the tools do not always play well together. The latest versions that have been found to work for Cross Platform development on an Apple Mac DEV environment is:
- MacOS Mojave v10.14.2
- Xcode v
- Cocoa Pods v
- Brew v
- Gradle v
- Oracle JDK v8u192
- Android Studio v3.21
- Meteor v

## Installation

Clone this repo and modify it to suit your needs.  If you want to use the secure and unsecure scripts, you need to install GPG2.

## Workflow (work in progress)

1. Edit ```fullstack-config.json``` to represent your project configuration.
2. Configure project ```$ meteor npm run config``` based on ```fullstack-config.json```.
3. Change code to perform business logic.
4. Bump version ```$ meteor npm run bump <type>``` where <type> is ```patch```/```minor```/```major```.
5. Start Web in DEV environment  ```$ meteor npm run startWebDev```.
6. Start iOS in DEV environment ```$ meteor npm run startIosDev```.
7. Start Android in DEV environment ```$ meteor npm run startAndroidDev```.
8. Build for STAGE environment ```$ meteor npm run buildStage```.
9. Deploy to STAGE environment ```$ meteor npm run deployStage```.
10. Start Web in STAGE environment ``` ```.
11. Start iOS in STAGE environment ``` ```.
12. Start Android in STAGE environment ``` ```.
13. Build for PROD environment ```$ meteor npm run buildProd```.
14. Optionally place base icon in ```resources``` folder.
15. Generate icons ```$ meteor npm run icons```.
16. If hot push only, goto 20.
17. Publish Mobile Apps to App Store and Play Store.
18. Wait for apps to be approved, Deploy to Galaxy.
19. Release apps on App Store and Play Store.
20. Deploy to PROD environment ```$ meteor npm run deployProd```.
21. Go to website and download apps from iOS App Store and Android Play Store.

## Secure

To secure the folder so that no sensitive files are unencrypted locally. While the folder is secured, you cannot deploy to PROD. Note that only encrypted production setting and certificates are added to the repository and unencrypted files are not added to the repository and thus this script must be executed after changing production settings, else risk losing your production settings.
```
$ meteor npm run secure
```

## Unsecure

To unsecure the folder so that sensitive files are locally available decrypted, and ready for deployment.
```
$ meteor npm run unsecure
```

### Install HomeBrew
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## Graphical Resources
If you are publishing this app on the Web, iOS App Store or Android Play, you will need a gazillion icons and splash screens of your logo. Either hire a full time graphic designer, or install ImageMagick, supply one ```logo.svg``` as base, and run our script to generate it for you in a few seconds for free :)

### Install ImageMagick
```
$ brew install imagemagick
$ brew install ghostscript
$ nano ~.bash_profile
export MAGICK_HOME=/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Android/sdk
```

### Original Artwork
Optionally place your 2048x2048 base icon/logo ```icon.svg``` or ```icon.png``` in the ```<PROJECT>/resources``` folder.

You or your graphic designer can design a logo using Gimpshop or Adobe Illustrator, or you can use freemium online services such as:
* [logomakr.com](https://logomakr.com/)
* [logojoy](https://logojoy.com)

### Auto Generated Base Icon

If you do not provide a base icon, a simple text based logo will be auto generated from your human project name for you.

Customization options in ```fullstack-config.json```:
```
{
  "humanName": "Meteor Fullstack",
  "icons": {
    "backgroundColor": "white",
    "font": "~/projects/meteor-fullstack/public/fonts/roboto/Roboto-Bold.woff",
    "textStrokeColor": "black",
    "textStrokeWidth": "1",
    "textFillColor": "black"
  }
}
```
The icons object is completely optional. The font can be a path or the name of an installed font, e.g. ```TimesNewRoman```, the default used being ```Roboto-Bold```, which is included in this repository. To see which fonts ImageMagick finds on your machine, use:
```
$ convert -list font
```

### Generate Icons

After installing ImageMagick and GhostScript and providing your own icon, or configuring your auto generated icon or even if you did nothing at all. Just run this script, and watch the magic happen:
```
$ meteor npm run icons
```

### Tiny Icons
Resizing large images to tiny images is difficult without it being fuzzy, usually image resizing is just not good enough. You could consider using [pixilart.com](https://www.pixilart.com) to manually design a crisp favicon based on your base icon.

```
$ meteor npm run generateImages
```

### Run on iOS with Simulator in DEV Environment

> ** Prerequisite ** Requires an Apple Mac computer

1. Open App Store on your Mac and install Xcode, start Xcode and accept licence and components.

2. in project folder:
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
$ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
$ meteor add-platform ios
```

3. Run on iOS Simulator in DEV environment
```
$ meteor npm run ios
```
This will cause Xcode to pop up with your project loaded. Select an simulator in the Xcode project and click run.

### Run on iOS Local Device in DEV Environment

> ** Prerequisite ** Requires Apple developer account

1. [Register iOS App ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle)

2. [Add iOS Certificate](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/certificate/create) for iOS App Development

3. [Add Device](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/create). To get your device UDID, open iTunes, select the device and click on its serial number.

4. Connect iOS device to your Mac and unlock it.

5. Start Xcode and add developer account to Xcode:
Toolbar Menu > Preferences > Accounts > Add Apple ID

6.
```
$ meteor npm run ios
```
This will cause Xcode to open up with your project loaded.

7. Enable In-App Purchase in the project capabilities.

8. Select the device in the Xcode project and click run.

### Run on Android with Simulator in DEV Environment

1. Install [Java Development Kit 8u192](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Do not install JDK 9, 10 or 11, it does not work with Meteor/Cordova yet.

2. Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/), start Android Studio and run the setup wizard.

3. Install Gradle

on Mac
```
$ brew install gradle
```

4. Set ```ANDROID_HOME``` and add the tools directories to your ```PATH```. This [article](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-set-android-sdk-path-in-windows-and-mac/) shows how to set Android SDK path in Windows and Mac.

on Mac
```
$ cd ~
$ nano .bash_profile
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/<USERNAME>/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
$ source .bash_profile
```

5. Open Android Studio SDK Manager and select SDK Platforms tab. Install Android API Level 26. Select SDK Tools tab and ensure Android SDK Platform-tools (latest) and Android SDK Build-tools (latest) are installed.

6. The Meteor guide advises against using Android simulators. If you sill want to give it a go you can [create an Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

It seems that you have to create a project before the Android Studio toolbar is shown. Once the toolbar is shown, it can take some time before the AVD Manager item is shown in the Tools menu.

It used to be possible to start AVD Manager from the command line in older versions of Android Studio, but it does not seem to work anymore.

7. in project folder:
```
$ meteor add-platform android
```

8. connect your android device to your computer

9. in project folder:
```
$ meteor npm run android
```

10. If this is the first time using this device for development with this computer, a popup will open on the device, asking you to Allow USB debugging. Click on OK.

# Publish to Apple App Store

1. ```$ meteor npm run buildStage```
2. ```$ meteor npm run xcode```
3. Go to toolbar menu ```File > Project Settings > Build System``` and select ```Legacy Build System```
